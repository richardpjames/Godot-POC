# Godot POC Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow me to trial and prototype new ideas. This is not a full game, but a basic implementation of a 
number of concepts and ideas.

## C# Implementation

The first purpose of this project was to test using the GODOT engine with C#. When using Unity I have much preferred the workflow provided 
by working in Visual Studio and C# for code changes, but using the Unity editor for actually building out my game.

However - I have never been completely happy with Unity as a full solution, primarily because of performance concerns (building the domain
each time you want to test a change can be exhausting).

Initially aiming to build a small game where a character can walk around an island and attack enemies (which attack in return) while keeping track 
of health will allow me to test out the main features of the engine.
